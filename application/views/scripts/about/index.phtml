    <h2>My Other Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I am a keen gardener and can often be found spending many an hour tending to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157627138470332/">my garden</a> which, this year, will contain strawberries, raspberries, black- and redcurrants, tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic, bell peppers and chilli peppers, in addition to various purely-ornamental plants.</li>
        <li>I also enjoy some amount of DIY around the house and garden, such as my recent work <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157626366347274/">laying a patio</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157629335306510/">creating a wall-mounted rack for our Guitar Hero guitars</a>. I was, of course, aided by <a href="http://www.benroberts.net/">my housemate</a> with this work.</li>
        <li>Despite having forgotten a lot since A-level, I enjoy playing around with small electronics projects, even if they're as simple as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157621882273432/">replacing a broken microswitch in a Guitar Hero controller</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157626499529915/">installing a key switch in a PC case</a>. I have some ideas for projects to make use of <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and/or <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> boards that I would love to explore when I have a little more free time.</li>
        <li>I am also something of an aspiring photographer, as the above links to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/">my Flickr profile</a> may suggest. I don't own a DSLR (nor do I necessarily want one - I appreciate the moderately-compact size of my current camera, a <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_Camera/PowerShot/PowerShot_SX200_IS/">Canon PowerShot SX200 IS</a>) and don't always know all of the technical details behind what I'm doing, but I love experimenting and learning, and my camera has enough manual controls (especially with the CHDK custom firmware) to allow me a large degree of freedom and control.</li>
        <li>An extension of my photography hobby is some amount of an interest in astronomy. This mostly consists of taking <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorddeath/sets/72157629335364882/">photographs of the night sky</a>, which is rarely impressive without a telescope - a problem that I hope to fix before long.</li>
        <li>It will likely come as no surprise to learn that I'm also an avid <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-GB/Profile?gamertag=Zweiblumen">Xbox 360 gamer</a> for a very large range of games, from first-person shooters, through RPGs, racers and music games, with some "casual" games thrown in for good measure. I do also possess a Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't see much use besides for Zelda games. I may, however, get a copy of Mario Kart shortly.</li>

    <h2>My History</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent">Kent</a>, in the south-east of England, in 1987, then fairly promptly moved 40 miles south-west into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex">East Sussex</a> where I remained until I went to university at 18.</li>
        <li>I was interested in computer programming from an early age and would often experiment with writing simple programs for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> long before I started secondary school.</li>
        <li>Once we bought our first family PC in 1998 (a 233 MHz AMD K6 with a 2 GB HDD and something like 64 MB of RAM, for which we paid £1000) and got our first Internet connection about a year later, I quickly found my way to IRC and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC">mIRC</a>, and became fairly heavily involved in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language">mIRC scripting</a>.</li>
        <li>I'd had something that could loosely be described as a "website" thanks to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com">Angelfire</a> for some time before we had a home Internet connection - a site that was created and modified mostly on the PCs at <a href="http://www.uctc.org.uk/">my secondary school's</a> library, however getting a home connection gave me a renewed interest in the Web. I thus created a new website in Microsoft Word and, realising how unbelievably bloated the resulting HTML was, effectively taught myself HTML by stripping out Word's bloat and seeing what changed. Before long I was creating sites in Microsoft FrontPage (utilising both its WYSIWYG editor and raw HTML editor) and then moved onto writing the HTML by hand, having somewhat lost faith in the ability of WYSIWYG editors to create sane markup.</li>
        <li>From there I moved into JavaScript and then PHP, somewhere around the time when PHP 4 was released (the year 2000 or so).</li>
        <li>A few years later I started playing on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> persistent world server called <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Community_News.Detail&id=433">Dark Century: X</a>. This gave me the perfect opportunity to both indulge in some programming for that server, using the game's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWScript">NWScript</a> language (a language that is sometimes described as "bastardised C") and to create a "fan site" for that persistent world, the <a href="http://udcx.com/">Unofficial Dark Century: X (uDCX) site</a>, which is still running today. The uDCX site is also home to what is still one of my proudest achievements in terms of visually-impressive work: a <a href="http://udcx.com/GMaps/">Google Maps-based map of the game world</a>, with a competely custom tileset and user interface.</li>
        <li>In the year before I went to university (2005), I accidentally created a very successful Web-based IM service called <a href="http://www.web2messenger.com/">Web2Messenger</a>, which ended up with around 15,000 registered users by the time the service was, for various reasons, discontinued sometime in 2008. I've written <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'web2messenger'), 'default', true) ?>">a more in-depth page about Web2Messenger</a>.</li>
        <li>In the middle of my university course I had a work-placement year which I spent working for <a href="http://www.craigbrass.net/">a friend</a> and <a href="http://www.craigbrasssystems.com/">his new company</a>. This consisted of starting the creation of a new e-commerce platform written in PHP 5. I was working alone for the majority of that year, however a few months before I had to return to university, a few external developers were brought onto the project to continue it while I was away. As such, I had to teach them how our system worked and then I monitored their progress, reviewing their code and pointing out bugs and security vulnerabilities in between my final-year studies - a situation that, in retrospect, was far from ideal. After finishing university I returned to the company working on the same software as before and retaining the same team-management role which I had before. I have now worked for Craig Brass Systems for almost four years (five, if you include the minor team-management final year at university).</li>
        <li>My <a href="<?php echo $this->baseUrl() ?>/files/Level_3_Project.pdf">final-year project</a> at university consisted of the creation of an improved version of Amazon.com's product recommendation engine. Amazon's existing product recommendation system does not (or, at least, did not in 2008 when I started the project) helpfully handle gift purchases. This would cause your own product recommendations to be polluted by suggestions of products that would appeal to the recipient of the gift you've bought, instead of ones that would appeal to yourself. Amazon offers/offered a checkbox for each product in your purchase history to exclude it from recommendations, however I felt that this could be taken a step further by using that purchase to suggest products to the gift's recipient, instead of simply ignoring the purchase entirely. I also included ideas for extending the system with additional social networking features, such as reminding people of a friend's upcoming birthday along with suggesting a suitable gift. This project involved the use of MySQL stored procedures for performance reasons, and the PHP code included in the appendices of <a href="<?php echo $this->baseUrl() ?>/files/Level_3_Project.pdf">the report document</a> is a reasonable guide of my personal code style and quality (whereas the PHP projects on GitHub that are linked to at the side of this page are mostly personal projects with little need to be nicely-structured or documented, so they mostly aren't).</li>

        <li class="strike">Has an <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'blog', 'action'=>'rss'), 'default', true) ?>">RSS feed of blog posts</a>.
        <li>Tested in <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome 18</a> (primarily), <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox 4</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera 11.5</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ie">Internet Explorer 10 (preview)</a>. Slightly older browsers (Firefox 3.6, Opera 10, IE9...) <strong>should</strong> work with minor style issues, but you're on your own with older versions of Internet Explorer - this is my personal space, so I have no intention of spending days hacking IE6 into submission... IE6, IE7 and IE8 have all been tested to the point that I know that the site is usable, but they have progressively more major styling issues as the version number drops.</li>
